         <p>The <b>HyperText Markup Language</b> or <b>HTML</b> is the standard <a

            documents designed to

            a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser" target="_blank">web
               browser</a>. It can be assisted by technologies such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS"

            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language" target="_blank">scripting languages</a>

         <p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser">Web browsers</a> receive HTML documents from a <a
               href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server">web server</a> or from local storage and
            <a href="">render</a> the
            documents into multimedia web
            pages. HTML describes the structure of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_page">web page</a> <a
               href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web">semantically</a> and originally
            included cues for the appearance
            of the
            document.
         <p>HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as
            interactive
            forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by
            denoting
            structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items. HTML
            elements are
            delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as
            <code> <span>&lt;</span><span>img</span><span>/&gt;</span></code> and
            <code><span>&lt;</span><span>input</span><span>/&gt;</span></code>
            directly introduce content
            into the
            page. Other tags such as
            <code><span>&lt;</span><span>p</span><span>&gt;</span></code>surround and provide information about document
            text
            and may
            include other tags as
            sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.

         <h3>Development</h3>
         <p>In <mark>1980</mark>, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a
            system for CERN
            researchers
            to use and share documents. In <mark>1989</mark>, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based
            hypertext system.
            Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late <mark>1990</mark>. That year,
            Berners-Lee and
            CERN data
            systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not
            formally
            adopted
            by CERN. In his personal notes from 1990 he listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used"
            and put an
            encyclopedia first.</p>
         <p>The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags", first mentioned on the
            Internet by
            Tim Berners-Lee in late <mark>1991</mark>. It describes 18 elements comprising the initial, relatively
            simple
            design of
            HTML.
            Except for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly influenced by SGMLguid, an in-house Standard Generalized
            Markup
            Language (SGML)-based documentation format at CERN. Eleven of these elements still exist in HTML 4.</p>
         <p>HTML is a markup language that web browsers use to interpret and compose text, images, and other material
            into
            visual or
            audible web pages. Default characteristics for every item of HTML markup are defined in the browser, and
            these
            characteristics can be altered or enhanced by the web page designer's additional use of CSS. Many of the
            text
            elements
            are found in the <mark>1988</mark> ISO technical report TR 9537 Techniques for using SGML, which in turn
            covers
            the features of early
            text formatting languages such as that used by the RUNOFF command developed in the early <mark>1960s</mark>
            for
            the CTSS (Compatible
            Time-Sharing System) operating system: these formatting commands were derived from the commands used by
            typesetters to
            manually format documents. However, the SGML concept of generalized markup is based on elements (nested
            annotated ranges
            with attributes) rather than merely print effects, with also the separation of structure and markup; HTML
            has
            been
            progressively moved in this direction with CSS.</p>

         <h2 id="markup">Markup</h2>
         <hr>
         <p>HTML markup consists of several key components, including those called tags (and their attributes),
            character-based data
            types, character references and entity references. HTML tags most commonly come in pairs like
            <code><span>&lt;</span><span>h1&gt;</span></code> and <code><span>&lt;</span><span>/h1&gt;</span></code>,
            although
            some represent empty elements and so are unpaired, for example
            <code><span>&lt;</span><span>img&gt;</span></code>.
            The first tag in such a pair is the
            start tag, and
            the second is the end tag (they are also called opening tags and closing tags).
            <code><br>
            &emsp;<span></span><span class="cp">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span><br>
            &emsp;<span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">html</span><span class="p">&gt;</span><br>
               &emsp;<span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">head</span><span class="p">&gt;</span><br>
                  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">title</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>This is a title<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">title</span><span class="p">&gt;</span><br>
               &emsp;<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">head</span><span class="p">&gt;</span><br>
               &emsp;<span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">body</span><span class="p">&gt;</span><br>
                  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">div</span><span class="p">&gt;</span><br>
                     &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>Hello world!<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span><br>
                  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">div</span><span class="p">&gt;</span><br>
               &emsp;<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">body</span><span class="p">&gt;</span><br>
            &emsp;<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">html</span><span class="p">&gt;</span><br>
            
            </code>
         </p>
         <h3>Elements</h3>
         <p>HTML documents imply a structure of nested HTML elements. These are indicated in the document by HTML tags,
            enclosed in
            angle brackets thus: <code><span>&lt;</span><span>p&gt;</span></code>.
         </p>
         <p>In the simple, general case, the extent of an element is indicated by a pair of tags: a "start tag"
            <code><span>&lt;</span><span>p&gt;</span></code> and "end tag"
            <code><span>&lt;</span><span>/p&gt;</span></code>. The text content of the element, if any, is placed
            between
            these tags.
         </p>
         <p>Tags may also enclose further tag markup between the start and end, including a mixture of tags and text.
            This indicates
            further (nested) elements, as children of the parent element.</p>
         <h3>Attributes</h3>
         <p>Most of the attributes of an element are name–value pairs, separated by = and written within the start tag
            of an element
            after the element's name. The value may be enclosed in single or double quotes, although values consisting
            of certain
            characters can be left unquoted in HTML (but not XHTML). Leaving attribute values unquoted is considered
            unsafe. In contrast with name-value pair attributes, there are some attributes that affect the element
            simply by
            their presence in the start tag of the element, like the ismap attribute for the img element.</p>
         <h3>Character and entity references</h3>
         <p>As of version 4.0, HTML defines a set of 252 character entity references and a set of 1,114,050 numeric
            character
            references, both of which allow individual characters to be written via simple markup, rather than
            literally. A literal
            character and its markup counterpart are considered equivalent and are rendered identically.</p>
